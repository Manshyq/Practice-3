For creating this  wave I have used only HTML and CSS.

- In HTML I created a section with four divs for each wave
- Each wave has a subclass such as wave1, wave2, wave3, wave4
- For waves I used a link:

```css
background:url(data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 800 88.7'%3E%3Cpath d='M800 56.9c-155.5 0-204.9-50-405.5-49.9-200 0-250 49.9-394.5 49.9v31.8h800v-.2-31.6z' fill='%23003F7C'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
```
which I took from https://codepen.io

- For each in CSS I set different opacities, z-indexes, delays and animations
- I used @keyframes to set each animation
